Self Driving cars - python codes
This is my python codes for understanding the tech behind self driving cars. I used Udacity Self driving car simulator to capture the data , Keras, OpenCV, tensorflow and machine learning libraries for coding this program.

I have uploaded 2 codes here for your reference: 

1. Lane detection code
2. Traffic sign detection
2. behaviour cloning code which include the data augmentation technique etc.
